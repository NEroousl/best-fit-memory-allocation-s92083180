# Best Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm

## Description

This project demonstrates the **Best Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm**, which is a memory management technique used in operating systems to allocate processes to memory blocks. The algorithm allocates each process to the smallest available block that fits the process size, minimizing wasted memory and reducing fragmentation.

### Key Features:
- **Best Fit Allocation**: Allocates processes to memory blocks with the least remaining space after allocation.
- **Memory Block Management**: Tracks memory usage and updates the available memory after each allocation.
- **Process Allocation**: Displays the allocation status of processes, including those that couldn't be allocated due to insufficient memory.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides the number and sizes of memory blocks, along with the sizes of processes to be allocated.
2. **Memory Allocation**: The program uses the Best Fit algorithm to allocate processes to the blocks.
3. **Display Results**: After allocation, the program shows the allocation status of each process and the remaining memory in each block.
